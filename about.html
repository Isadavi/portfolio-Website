                    <p>My fascination with problem-solving dates back to my childhood—a persistent curiosity that propelled me to unravel puzzles and find solutions independently. This innate trait has matured into a professional ethos, positioning me as a self-starter recognized for delivering results with resilience and determination.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I channel my interest in technology into personal projects.
